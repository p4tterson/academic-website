abstract: "The key goal of this research is to promote the development of accessible and transferrable conceptual knowledge.
We hypothesize that the limitations of human, similarity- based retrieval can be overcome by focusing on teaching scientific principles as categories (Gentner & Kurtz, 2005; Bernardo, 1994; Blessing & Ross, 1996; Cummins, 1992). This paper reports on findings from two classroom experiments focused on a well-studied psychological task known as category construction (Imai & Garner, 1965, 1968; Medin, Wattenmaker, & Hampson, 1987). Historically, category construction techniques have been used as a means of assessing individuals’ knowledge after a learning activity (as opposed to using category construction for learning). Here we investigate the effectiveness of category construction as a tool for promoting individuals’ mastery of complex concepts and their ability to apply this knowledge in distinct domains."
